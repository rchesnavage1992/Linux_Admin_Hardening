## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 644 /etc/group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):sudo adduser sam   
    sudo adduser joe  sudo adduser amy  sudo adduser sara   sudo adduser admin

2. Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.

    - Command to edit `pwquality.conf` file: sudo nano pwquality.conf

    - Updates to configuration file:
    
    difok = 5  minlen = 16  dcredit = 0 ucredit = 0 lcredit = 0 ocredit = -2 minclass = 4
3. Force sswords to expire every 90 days.

    - Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users): 
    sudo chage sam  
    sudo chage joe
    sudo chage amy
    sudo chage sara
    sudo chage admin
4. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo groupadd engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):
    sudo adduser sam engineers
    sudo adduser joe engineers
    sudo adduser sara engineers
    sudo adduser amy engineers

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: 
    sudo mkdir -p /home/engineers/
    sudo groupadd engineers
    sudo groupadd new_engineers
    sudo chgrp -R new_engineers /home/engineers/
    sudo chmod 770 /home/engineers/
    sudo usermod -a -G new_engineers sam #(repeat for each user)

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
    sudo chown root:engineers engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: sudo lynis show help

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system -Q

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output:


### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit: sudo apt install chkrootkit

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man chkrootkit

3. Command to run expert mode: sudo chkrootkit -x 

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
    - Screenshot of end of sample output:
